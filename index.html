    Hello World!!!! If you're seeing it that means I have made
    <br>
    it through the death defying Skilldisillery pre-work...Big shout out
    <br>
    to Helen and Webster; for guiding me towards this path, and also to
    <br>
    the youtubers who provided the java content that filled in gaps where I was
    <br>
    was lacking in knowledge, also it may or may not have prevented a macbook
    <br>
    from taking flight across the room......on more than a few occasions.....
    <br>
    <br>
    My experience coming into Skilldisillery consisted of maybe two or three months
    <br>
    of html over twenty years ago in highschool, and incomplete typing skills.
    <br>
    Previously I was working as a ship Captain which was not a good fit
    <br>
    for a single father. Even working jobs where I could be home every night,
    <br>
    the hours and wages were not worth it, having to provide by myself.
    <br>
    My hope is that by aquiring tech skills, I can provide a better life for my kids.
    <br>
    <br>
    Pre-work......Looks like I missed my first deadline...Hoping to not make that a habbit.
    <br>
    In all honesty I did it to myself. My adamant disdain for apple products is part of the
    <br>
    problem... I'm a PC guy through and through and a firm beleiver that mac's make very good
    <br>
    bricks, doorstops, and paper weights which we will get into in future blogs.
    <br>
    Unfortunatly for me, an apple desktop or not book is required by Skilldisillery.
    <br>
    I started some of the pre-work on my pc, thinking nothing of it, but when I
    <br>
    was finally able to get a mac(Why are even the used ones so expensive!?!?),
    <br>
    github wasn't having any of it. I was not able to configure my github account to my macbook
    <br>
    after having configured it to my pc in September. Double face palm for me, cause I waited
    <br>
    till the day before the pre-work was do to scorch my github account and start fresh from the mac.
    <br>
    <br>
    Last paragraph. The first four Lab sections were not to bad, after that I found myself having to
    <br>
    sleep on solutions and get some rest. I am wondering if mental endurance will be built or if i'm
    <br>
    finding hard limitations, cause I feel like i'm a bit old to be switching into this career path.
    <br>
    So far I think my biggest frustration is those curly braces "} {"...I've gone through lines of
    <br>
    code with a fine tooth comb....sometimes even re-writing the entire lab, just to find out it was
    <br>
    a stupid curly brace keeping functions from initializing.....That is all for now, probably more
    <br>
    tomorrow.
